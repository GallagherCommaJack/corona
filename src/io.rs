/// A wrapper to turn async IO streams into sync ones.
///
/// This can be used to wrap an asynchronous stream â€’ anything that is `AsyncRead` or `AsyncWrite`
/// (like tokio's `TcpStream`) into a sync one. When performing IO, the current coroutine is
/// suspended, but the thread isn't blocked.
///
/// This makes it possible to use blocking API (for example `serde_json::from_reader`) on
/// asynchronous primitives.
///
/// Note that if `T` is `AsyncRead` (or `AsyncWrite`), `&mut T` is too. Therefore, it is possible
/// both to turn the stream into a sync one permanently (or, until the wrapper is unwrapped with
/// [`into_inner`](#method.into_inner)), or just temporarily.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # extern crate corona;
/// # extern crate tokio;
/// use std::io::{Read, Result as IoResult};
/// use corona::io::BlockingWrapper;
/// use tokio::net::TcpStream;
///
/// fn blocking_read(connection: &mut TcpStream) -> IoResult<()> {
///     let mut connection = BlockingWrapper::new(connection);
///     let mut buf = [0u8; 64];
///     // This will block the coroutine, but not the thread
///     connection.read_exact(&mut buf)
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Using the wrapped object may panic in these circumstances:
///
/// * If it is used outside of a coroutine (as there's nothing to suspend at that time).
/// * If the tokio core is dropped while waiting for data.

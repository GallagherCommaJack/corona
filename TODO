* Unclean shutdowns
  - When the Core drops we need to get rid of all the waiting stacks and
    everything on them somehow.
  - Using panic to unwind the waiting coroutine might work, but might be
    problematic in certain situations. Dropping just the stack doesn't seem
    good either.
* Stream adaptor for iteration
* License, documentation, etc
* Examples
* External tests
* Cache the stacks, as they are probably expensive to create (they call mmap
  and manipulating the memory mappings flushes the whole TLB).
* Pass the instructions through the usize (ugly, but probably better than the TLS).

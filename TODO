* Unclean shutdowns
  - Cleanup iterators and generators
  - What do we do during a panic? Configuration option? But only on the non-cleanup methods?
* documentation, etc
* Examples
* External tests
* Pass the instructions through the usize (ugly, but probably better than the TLS).
* Think about some thread support ‒ do we want some? How would it integrate in the API?
* Look at the unwind safety and unwinding in general.
* Try to get rid of so many 'static bounds everywhere ‒ like when awaiting.
* Something like select
* Wait for future with timeout?
* Document why the unsafe blocks are in fact safe
* Build fails on half of appveyor ‒ seems like some issue with compiler, look if it can be made work
* Document the way to deadlock
* Can we rely on *any* future executor?
* Generators might want to run only when next is called on them
  - How will their clean up work?
* https://github.com/laumann/compiletest-rs
  - Try that we can't block inside a future modifier

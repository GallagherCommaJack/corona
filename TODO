* Unclean shutdowns
  - When the Core drops we need to get rid of all the waiting stacks and
    everything on them somehow.
  - Using panic to unwind the waiting coroutine might work, but might be
    problematic in certain situations. Dropping just the stack doesn't seem
    good either.
* License, documentation, etc
* Examples
* External tests
* Cache the stacks, as they are probably expensive to create (they call mmap
  and manipulating the memory mappings flushes the whole TLB).
* Pass the instructions through the usize (ugly, but probably better than the TLS).
* Think about some thread support ‒ do we want some? How would it integrate in the API?
* Ability to spawn coroutines with smaller stack.
* Look at the unwind safety and unwinding in general.
* Try to get rid of so many 'static bounds everywhere ‒ like when awaiting.
* Generators (through a wrapper around Await) that produce a stream instead of future
* Builder pattern to create the coroutines ‒ spawn will have only the closure.
* Yield (future that is ready right away)

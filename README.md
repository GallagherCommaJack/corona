# Corona

This is an experiment aiming to integrate coroutines with futures in Rust. It
works, but is still considered very experimental and the API will likely
change. Also, there are several yet unsolved problems.

You want to read the [docs](https://docs.rs/corona).

When you try it out, I'm interested in hearing some feedback (if it works, if the
API could be improved somehow).

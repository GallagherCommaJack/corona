# Corona

[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/vorner/corona.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vorner/corona)
[![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ygytb97bion810ru/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vorner/corona/branch/master)

Stackfull coroutines in Rust, integrating well with
[futures](https://crates.io/crates/futures).

This is often more convenient than using just futures or
[futures-await](https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await) (and works on
stable). But it comes with a runtime cost.

You want to read the [docs](https://docs.rs/corona) and examine the
[examples](https://github.com/vorner/corona/tree/master/examples).

When you try it out, I'm interested in hearing some feedback (if it works for
you, if the API could be improved somehow).
